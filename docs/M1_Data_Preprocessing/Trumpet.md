# Post-alignment Quality Assessment with Trumpet

The trumpet R package is a valuable tool for assessing the quality of m6A-seq data. It takes the aligned BAM files of m6A-seq data together with the transcriptome annotation as the inputs, and returns an assessment report concerning the data quality.



> **Issue**:
>
> The installation of Trumpet needs 'exomePeak' while 'exomePeak' is not available for R version 4.0.2 (98 server)
>
> Repo address: https://github.com/skyhorsetomoon/Trumpet
