## Checking Databases

By checking the following databases before analyzing the datasets, we could have a basic understanding of the data in terms of estimated quantitative profiles, conservation, biological functions, annotation, and disease association of epi-transcriptome.



### m6A_Atlas

[m6A-Atlas](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/atlas) is a comprehensive knowledgebase for unraveling the m6A epitranscriptome [3].



### RMDisease

[RMDisease](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/rmd) is a database of genetic variants that affect RNA modifications, with implications for epitranscriptome pathogenesis [4].



### WHISTLE

[WHISTLE](http://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/biologicalsciences/whistle) is a high-accuracy map of the human m6A epitranscriptome predicted using a machine learning approach [5].
