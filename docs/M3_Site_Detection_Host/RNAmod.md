## RNA Annotation (RNAmod)

[RNAmod](http://61.147.117.195/RNAmod/) is a convenient web-based platform for the meta-analysis and functional annotation of modifications on mRNAs [14].

To obtain modification site information, click on "Single case" in the [Home page](http://bioinformatics.sc.cn/RNAmod/index.php), upload the BED file generated from exomePeak2 package, and submit the job. Then you will receive a job ID and will use it to query the job status and get the results in the [result page](http://bioinformatics.sc.cn/RNAmod/results.php). You can either view the results on browser or download the zip file to the local place. 

Some of the figures about modification site information are displayed below:
